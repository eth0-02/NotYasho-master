# Geo-Coded Sanity Studio

This folder contains the Sanity Studio used for writing blog posts. The Studio configuration reads your project ID and dataset from environment variables so you can easily connect it to your own Sanity project.

## Getting Started

1. Copy the `.env.example` file from the project root to `.env` and fill in your `SANITY_PROJECT_ID` and `SANITY_DATASET` values.
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Run the studio with `npm run dev`.

For more details see the "Setting Up Sanity CMS" section in the main `README.md`.
